The Site / Concept
- homepage on georeactor.com
- readme

CLI and server
- KML input
- break into modules - consuming file, editor
- upgrade Leaflet libs to 1.0
- quick client-side lib with field names?
- include github helpers, or use georeactor.com

The Editor
- design the react sidebar editor separately, but with some step-by-step creation stuff
- set a primary field (like NAME) and rest are subfields
- identify / ask for a unique ID (like OBJECTID) and make it link
- special content types (videos, images, links)

Output
- design the responsive sidebar
- how many users just need a static site, how much can be done with Heroku API maker?
- more static site APIs, for example queryLatLng instead of just clicking
- MapBoxGL / Tangram support, now that Leaflet works
