The Site / Concept
- readme

CLI and server
- break editor and server into modules
- quick client-side lib with field names?
- test uploader and auth
- include github helpers, or post maps to georeactor.com

The Editor
- design the react sidebar editor separately, but with some step-by-step creation stuff
- have a point to asking for unique ID, like hash link
- change order of non-title fields
- jump back to editing a shown field
- special content types (videos, images, links)

Output
- design the responsive sidebar
- how many users just need a static site, vs some Heroku API maker?
- more static site APIs, for example queryLatLng instead of just clicking
- MapBoxGL / Tangram support, now that Leaflet works
